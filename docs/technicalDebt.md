# Technical Debt — BlueGrid Land Solutions

**Last updated:** 2026-08-15 (closeout after production launch, upload hardening and the Drive access rework)

**Resolved this closeout:** items 1 (domain), 11 (robots/sitemap), 24d (photo access — now `rootInherited`, externally verified).
**Newly opened:** 12a (apex vs www), 24g (header-only content validation), 24h (HEIC removed — watch traffic), 24i (retention policy).
**Sharpened:** 12 (`og:image` still relative on all 28 pages — the highest-value open item), 24b (worst case 96MB → 25MB), 24c (orphan reclamation).

Known debt, deferred work, and intentional trade-offs. Items are ordered by launch impact, not by effort.

## High Priority

### 1. ~~Production domain undecided~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-15**
`bluegridlandsolutions.com` is live and serving. `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` both exist (**28 URLs**, matching the 28 tracked HTML pages).

**What may still be outstanding inside this item:** the canonical / `og:url` / `og:image` sweep was TODO-marked across every page head when the domain was undecided. Whether those TODOs were cleared during the production deployment is **not verifiable from this repository** — the deployment happened outside any recorded session. **Next session: grep for `TODO: Replace canonical` and `TODO: Swap og:url` and confirm.** See items 10k and 12, which were both explicitly deferred *to* this sweep.

### 2. ~~Badge artwork typo — "FORESTRV"~~ — OFF THE WEBSITE 2026-08-11
The old badge (`bluegridBadge400.png`, `bluegridBadge192.png`) reads **"FORESTRV MULCHING & LAND CLEARING"** on its bottom arc, a V where the Y should be. Verified 2026-08-02 against the actual PNG.

**The website no longer uses that artwork.** The primary mark is now `bluegridMark290.png`, derived from the client's `circleBG_logo.png`, which carries no arc text at all — so the misspelling cannot appear on any page. All 76 references migrated.

**Still open outside the website:** the misspelled badge files remain on disk, and if the client has that artwork on a truck wrap, signage, business cards, or a GBP profile photo, it is still wrong there. `newBG_logo.png` spells **FORESTRY** correctly and is the asset to hand anyone who asks for print artwork.

### 3. ~~Placeholder contact details~~ — PHONE CONFIRMED 2026-08-13, EMAIL STILL OPEN
- Phone `(740) 464-2526` — **confirmed.** It is printed on Chase's own advertisement, `graphics/images/whatTheyDo2.jpg`, which is first-party marketing material sitting in this repository. Previous sessions recorded it as an unconfirmed flyer number; the flyer *is* the evidence, and nobody had opened it.
- Email `estimates@bluegridlandsolutions.com` — **still a placeholder.** It appears on no client artwork and may not route anywhere. Shipping an unrouted address loses leads silently.

Wired through `businessConfig`, so the email is a one-line fix once confirmed.

### 3a. Claims audit — what the client's own advertising does and does not support

Run 2026-08-13 during the P0 SEO pass. The three client artwork files in `graphics/images/` are first-party marketing material and had never been opened by any session. They settle several claims that were being treated as unverified, and fail to support two that were on the site.

**Verified by Chase's own advertising — keep:**

| Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|
| **Fully insured** | "FULLY INSURED" badge on both `whatTheyDo2.jpg` and `whatTheyDo.jpg` |
| **Locally owned and operated** | "LOCALLY OWNED & OPERATED" on `whatTheyDo.jpg` |
| **Phone (740) 464-2526** | Printed on `whatTheyDo2.jpg` |
| **Cleared in 1–2 days** | "…or have it cleared in 1-2 days?" on `BeforeandAfter.jpg` |
| **Free estimates** | "Call for a Free Estimate!" / "MESSAGE US TODAY FOR A FREE ESTIMATE!" |
| **Serving Ohio and surrounding areas** | Footer strip of `whatTheyDo.jpg` |
| **Tree and brush cleanup, debris removal and mulching, trail and access restoration** | The four service tiles on `whatTheyDo.jpg` |

**Not supported by anything in the repository — softened, and needs Chase to confirm or correct:**

- **"Free estimates within 24 hours."** No response time appears on any client artwork. The on-page copy hedges this ("*most* quotes go out within 24 hours"); three homepage meta/social descriptions stated it flat. Those three were brought into line with the hedged wording. **The hedged instances were left alone** — they are a soft claim, not a guarantee, and removing every mention would be over-correction. Ask Chase what he can actually commit to.
- **"Storm cleanup jumps the line … machine on site within days, not weeks."** An emergency-dispatch promise. Chase's own storm advert says "when the storm clears, we're just getting started", which is post-storm restoration, not emergency response. Reworded on `index.html` and `services/stormCleanup.html` to keep the priority-scheduling claim (his decision to make) and drop the on-site timeframe (a promise the site cannot keep for him).

**Checked and clean — nothing to fix:** no dollar figures anywhere on the site, no per-acre or hourly pricing, no insurance coverage amount, no tree-diameter or capability limit, no guaranteed-quote or zero-haul-off language, no invented reviews or ratings, and no street address, latitude, longitude or `priceRange` in any schema block.

**Still open:** "we send a certificate of insurance before the machine leaves the shop" is a specific operational promise that goes beyond the "FULLY INSURED" badge. Retained, because the underlying insurance claim is verified, but worth one sentence of confirmation from Chase.

### 3b. There is no tree-service page, and the P0 brief assumed there was one
The SEO brief called for an audit of a tree removal / tree cutting page. **No such page exists** — the site has seven service pages and tree work is not one of them.

Chase's own advertising does list "TREE & BRUSH CLEANUP" as a service tile, so there is a real, first-party-supported service here with no page behind it. That is a genuine P1 content opportunity rather than a defect. **Do not build it as a residential arborist page:** nothing verifies climbing, crane work, stump grinding, hazardous-tree capability, or any maximum diameter. The honest framing is tree and brush clearing for land improvement, which is what the advert actually claims.

### 4. Nothing has ever been checked in a real browser
No session on this project has had Playwright or Chrome DevTools available, so **every validation to date is static analysis or simulation.** That is strong for links, structure, schema, geometry, and the hero loop's state machine — and it says nothing about how anything *looks*.
Before launch: open the homepage on a real phone and confirm the hero photo ends at the fold, the seam into the estimate band is invisible, and the card overlap reads as intentional. Then a tablet and desktop pass covering the FAQ mega panel, the header morph across 1280px and 1150px, and the FAQ/Insights layouts.
**Added 2026-08-06:** the redesigned **services mega panel** has been measured but never seen — open it at 1440px and again at 1151px, where the calculation leaves only 62px between the panel and the left edge. And confirm the **hero typing** reads as intended now that it commits on the frame boundary; the profiler proves the cadence is regular, not that it looks right.
**Added 2026-08-07 (mega menus):** the two new featured icons — a map pin and a question mark — were drawn blind as SVG path data and have never been rendered. Check they read cleanly at 26px. Also confirm the muted region headings in Service Areas look deliberate rather than washed out, and that the hover bridge removed the flicker rather than making the panel sticky.

**Added 2026-08-07:** the **process sequence** is the largest untested-by-eye item on the site. The simulation proves the order and the viewport behaviour exactly; it says nothing about whether the dark board sits well on the white section, or whether the arrow flash is bright enough to read as a flash without being gaudy. Expect the timing constants in `processSequenceConfig` to need one tuning pass against a real screen.

**Added 2026-08-09 — the current list, in priority order:**

1. **The process handover at 1168px.** Load the homepage at 1200px, then 1170px, then 1160px. Above 1168px the board is horizontal at its full 1120px; below it, vertical. That boundary is what this session changed and is the direct answer to the clipping report — confirm the vertical layout is the better presentation there, and that nothing is cut off at any width.
2. **Phase A then Phase B.** Scroll the process section in and watch once: five steps reveal, then only the arrows should ever move again. Confirm **the arrows light at all during Phase B** — they are lit from a resting state, and an equal-specificity CSS collision there would leave the whole loop invisible. `lightArrow()` removes `isResting` first to prevent exactly that, but it has never been seen.
3. **Does the cumulative sweep read as intended?** The row should fill 1 → 1+2 → 1+2+3 → 1+2+3+4, hold with all four lit, then clear together. The open question is whether four simultaneously lit arrows read as *the progression completing* or just as four bright arrows — and whether the accumulation is legible at all at the arrow's 16px size and 0.26 → 1.0 opacity range. If it is not, the flash is the thing to strengthen, not the timing.
4. **Is 3.56s per pass right?** Phase B runs forever in the corner of the page: 420ms between arrows, a 1400ms hold, a 900ms pause. Too fast reads as a fidget. `loopStepMs` and `loopHoldMs` in `processSequenceConfig` are the two to tune.
5. **The Our Company panel** beside its three siblings at 1440px and again at 1201px, and the **shield-with-a-check featured icon**, drawn blind at 26px like the pin and question mark before it.

4b. **The new header mark at every breakpoint** (69px / 60px / 56px / 50px), and the **footer badge at 120px**, where a 290px source is doing the most work it will ever do. Also confirm the white circle reads correctly against the dark scrolled header.

4d. **The floating CTA bar on a real handset**, ideally one with a home indicator so `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` contributes something. Confirm both bottom corners render cleanly now and the bar keeps its breathing room above the indicator.

4c. **Whether the rewritten H2s still sound like the same site.** 36 headings moved from brand voice to topic on 2026-08-11. The reasoning is sound and the kickers still carry the rhythm, but that is a judgement about tone and it has not been read on a screen.

4e. ~~"Get My Free Estimate" arrival focus~~ — **superseded.** The scroll-and-focus fix this item described was replaced the same day: estimate CTAs now open the modal directly (see below), so there is no scroll to confirm. See 4f.

4f. **Every "Get My Free Estimate" CTA, opening the modal directly.** Click one from the header, then the hero, then the mobile floating bar, then a footer/mega-menu link, on both the homepage and an interior page. Confirm: no visible scroll or page movement before the modal appears; Step 1 shows all five fields (Name, Phone, Service, Address, Acres) under the heading "Where's the property?" — check whether that heading reads oddly now that it asks for more than the property, since it was deliberately left unedited; close and reopen the modal mid-fill and confirm it resumes rather than resets; and that the mini-form's own Continue button (still on the page, now feeding the modal instead of asking twice) carries its three fields into Step 1 pre-filled, not blank.

4h. **The four pages created on 2026-08-13, on a real screen.** `locations/index.html` and the Minford, Piketon and Jackson pages have never been rendered. They reuse only existing components and every validator passes, so the risk is presentation rather than breakage — but two things are worth a specific look.

   The **service-area hub** puts town links inside `benefitTitle` headings within `localProblemGrid` cards, which is a combination no existing page uses: check the links read as links and the cards still balance. The **local-proof gallery** on the three town pages uses `gallerySection`/`galleryGrid` lifted from the service pages, but Piketon has only **one** figure where that grid has only ever held three or four — confirm a single figure does not stretch oddly across the row.

   Also confirm the Service Areas mega panel still fits now that it carries 15 rows rather than 13. `validateMegaMenus` measures it and passes, but it has never been seen at that height.

4g. **The photo uploader, on a real phone, over a real mobile connection.** This is the largest untested-by-eye item on the site as of 2026-08-13, because the whole path is new and none of it can be proven from Node.
   Attach two or three photos straight from a phone camera roll and watch the bars: each should sit at **zero until Submit is pressed**, then fill one at a time as its photo actually uploads. A bar that races to full the moment a file is chosen means the old fake-progress code is back.
   Then confirm: **portrait photos arrive the right way up** (EXIF orientation is handled by `createImageBitmap(..., { imageOrientation: 'from-image' })` with an `<img>` fallback, and neither path has ever been run in a browser); a HEIC photo from an iPhone either uploads or fails cleanly rather than hanging; the submission still completes on a deliberately terrible connection; and the whole thing takes an acceptable amount of time with a dozen photos, since uploads are sequential by design.
   Finally, open the owner email on a phone and confirm the photo links are tappable and open the image rather than a Drive permission wall — that is item 24d, and a real device is the only place it can be settled.

6. **The company page** top to bottom — it reuses eight existing interior-page components in a combination none of them have been seen in.
7. **The header at 1361px and 1360px**, where the compact band now starts, and at 1201px, the last desktop width.

### 5. ~~No real lead has been created from the live site~~ — DONE 2026-08-13 (Aron), and now needs redoing
A genuine submission reached the sheet and the owner notification reached a test recipient. That test is what surfaced the photo defect, which has since been fixed — **so the pipeline it validated is no longer the pipeline that is deployed.**
**Rerun it after the Apps Script redeploy**, against the outcomes in `appsScript/README.md` step 10, which now include photos. The run that matters for launch is the final one with Chase restored as the recipient.

### 6. Service area pages: 6 of 13 cities have one
The `seoPlan.md` first wave shipped — Ashland, Portsmouth, Ironton, Chillicothe, Grayson, and Morehead.
Outstanding:
- **Rows 7–11** (Jackson OH, Gallipolis OH, Waverly OH, Greenup KY, Louisa KY) — staged for after the first six index. Their nav links still point at `#serviceAreas`, which resolves.
- **West Union, OH and Flatwoods, KY are advertised in the nav but appear nowhere in `seoPlan.md`'s 11-city table.** Either they get pages or they come out of the nav.

---

## Medium Priority

### 7. Location pages quote no prices
`seoPlan.md` content rule 5 asks location pages to answer cost directly with real ranges, and calls it the biggest opening in this trade because most competitors dodge it. **No page names a dollar figure** — no pricing has been approved, and inventing one would be a commitment the site cannot honour.
Each cost FAQ instead answers with the factors that move the price on that county's ground. Honest and locally unique, but the weaker answer.
**Fix: get rough per-acre or per-day ranges from Chase.** The single highest-value upgrade available, and it costs one conversation.

### 8. Thin photo library
13 images total for **28 pages**. Several are reused across service pages, location heroes, Insights heroes, and galleries.
Consequences already visible: two service pages (`stormCleanup`, `huntingPropertyPrep`) and **all 6 location pages** ship with no gallery, because no photo can be honestly captioned to a named town; and all 8 Insights pages use stand-in imagery (item 9).
Needs a real photo drop — ideally before/after pairs per service, **tagged by where they were taken**.

### 9. Insights imagery is placeholder
All eight Insights pages (landing + 7 articles) use existing BlueGrid job photos as stand-ins, each marked `TODO: PLACEHOLDER IMAGE` in the markup. They are real work photos so nothing is dishonest — but none was shot for its article and several repeat across pages.
The single biggest visual upgrade available to the section. Feeds directly off item 8.

### 10. Three homepage service cards hotlink Unsplash stock photos
Trail Cutting, Property Cleanup, and Hunting Property Prep load from `images.unsplash.com`. Two problems: a runtime dependency on a third party, and stock imagery on a site whose credibility rests on real work photos.
Deferred because replacing imagery needs client approval. Real unused photos exist (`cleanCut`, `freshMulching`, `overGrowth`, `whatTheyDo2`, `BeforeandAfter`).
**No new external hotlinks have been added since** — the Insights build deliberately used repo assets rather than making this worse.

### 10a. One duplicate FAQ question predates this session
**"Do I need a permit to clear land in Ohio or Kentucky?"** is rendered on **both `index.html` and `services/landClearing.html`**, with near-identical answers, and appears in both pages' `FAQPage` schema.
That violates `seoPlan.md`'s own rule ("No cross-page duplicate questions") and means two pages compete for the same query. Both were built in Phase 1, so it predates this session — it was found by the duplicate check written for the FAQ hub, which is the first thing that ever looked.
**Fix: decide which page owns it.** The permitting answer is service-agnostic, so the homepage or the new FAQ hub is the better home; `landClearing.html` would then drop the question and link across. Not done at closeout because it changes rendered content and schema on two pages and deserves a deliberate call rather than a rushed one.
Sitewide totals for reference: **103 rendered FAQ questions, 102 unique.**

### 10c. The hero typed line's `text-shadow` is the remaining per-character paint cost
`text-shadow: 0 3px 24px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.55)` on `.heroTypedText` means every keystroke re-rasters the whole string with a 24px blur: a **926×125px** rect at 1440px, ~115k pixels, roughly twelve times a second while a phrase types.
The 2026-08-06 pass removed everything around it — the write now lands on a frame boundary, and `.heroTypedLine` holds its own compositing layer so the hero photograph underneath is no longer resampled (**8.0 megapixels/second** saved). The blur itself is irreducible without changing how the hero looks, and the brief said not to.
**Only worth revisiting if a real device shows the hero dropping frames.** Softening the blur to ~12px would roughly halve the raster cost, and it is a visible change that needs sign-off, not a quiet optimization.

### 10d. `.heroTypedLine` holds a compositing layer for the life of the page
`will-change: transform` is set permanently, not toggled, because the typing loop never ends. Costs one layer of roughly 926×125px — well under a megabyte, and zeroed under `prefers-reduced-motion` where nothing types.
One consequence worth knowing before someone "fixes" it: text in a promoted layer gets grayscale rather than subpixel antialiasing. **The line was already promoted for the first 2.2 seconds** via the `[data-heroanimate]` entrance, so this makes the rendering consistent rather than introducing something new — and at 41–74px display type the difference is not expected to be visible. Unverified, like everything else in item 4.

### 10e. ~~The process section's visual was built from a description~~ — the design is now APPROVED
Kept as a pointer, not as debt: the floating dark rectangle, five steps, four arrowheads and CTA-below were confirmed by Aron on 2026-08-07 and **must not be redesigned.** The animation behaviour was rewritten on 2026-08-09 (one-time reveal, then an arrow-only loop) without touching any of it. Original note follows.

### 10e-context. How that visual came to exist
The 2026-08-07 brief framed the work as animation-only on top of an established visual — a centred free-floating dark rectangle, arrowheads between steps, no connecting line, CTA below. **That visual did not exist in this repository.** What shipped was a white section with a horizontal gradient rule and no arrowheads, and no branch, stash, commit, or other client site under `ClientSites/` had the described version.
It was therefore built to the description rather than matched to a reference. Everything the brief specified is present, but proportions, board darkness, and arrow weight are this build's interpretation.
**Fix: one look in a browser.** If it does not match what was pictured, the visual lives entirely in `.processBoard` / `.processArrow` and can be retuned without touching the sequencer.

### 10f. Process CTA duplicates a destination already on the page
`.processCta` adds `Get My Free Estimate` → `#estimateForm` below the board on all 8 pages. The service pages already carry that same anchor in the page hero, so those pages now offer it twice.
That is normal for a long page — a CTA at the top and another after the explainer is standard — but it was added because the brief called for a CTA below the container, not because a gap was measured. Worth a glance when the section is reviewed; removing it is one line in the markup on 8 pages.

### 10g. ~~Process board clipping at narrower desktop widths~~ — ADDRESSED 2026-08-09, mechanism never found
Kept in full because the honest version of this is more useful than "fixed".

**The 143px figure that framed this was a mis-pairing.** "MAINTENANCE" does measure 143px uppercase in Rokkitt — re-measuring reproduced it exactly — but it is on `services/brushRemoval.html`, a **four**-step board, whose column at 1081px is **197px**, not the 147px of a five-step board. It has 54px of clearance. The widest word on the five-step homepage board is "COMPLETE" at 104px against 147px.

Checked properly — every rendered title on all eight boards, uppercased as `text-transform` renders them, against its own board's column, every width 1081–1440px, with a 6% fallback-face inflation — **nothing overflows anywhere.** The box model agrees: `.processStep` is `flex: 1 1 0` with `min-width: 0`, `box-sizing: border-box` is global, and there is no `100vw` in the process chain. The board **provably cannot** overflow its container at any width in the band.

**So the reported symptom has no mechanism I can find, and it was not fixed by finding one.** What changed is that the horizontal row no longer runs compressed at all: the handover moved from 1080px to **1167px**, derived as `1120px` (board `max-width`) + `2 × 1.5rem` (section padding) — the narrowest viewport at which the board can render at its design width. Below 1168px it was being squeezed to 147px columns against a design value of 164px, and that band is where the report came from.

`.processStepTitle` also gained `overflow-wrap: break-word`. **That is a guard for the next title someone writes, not a fix for a current overflow.**

**If Aron still sees clipping after this, the mechanism is genuinely outside the box model** — browser zoom, a device pixel ratio effect, or something the static model cannot represent — and the next session should get a real browser on it rather than re-deriving the arithmetic, which is now known to be clean.

### 10h. ~~The Git remote URL is stale~~ — RESOLVED, confirmed at 2026-08-13 closeout
`origin` now points at `https://github.com/ArxnAlley/client_BluegridLandSolutions.git`, verified via `git remote -v`. No session recorded here ran the fix, and `origin/main` was also found to have moved ahead by a push this repository's history doesn't show — both point to activity happening outside these sessions, which is fine, just worth knowing the working tree isn't the only place this project changes.

### 10i. The validator toolchain lives outside the repository
Fourteen suites (thirteen, plus validateFrontendPhotoPolicy added 2026-08-15), the guarded assemblers, the font-metric models, the copy-rewrite tables, the SEO intent checks, and now the estimate-CTA checks exist only in a session scratchpad, carried forward by hand between sessions. **This is the most fragile thing about how this project is worked on.** Losing it would cost more than any single feature in the repo: `validateSeo` alone encodes the intent map, the FAQ schema contract, and the anti-cannibalisation rule.
`projectState.md` tells the next session to locate it first, which is a mitigation rather than a fix. The reason it is out of the repo is item 17's decision not to ship half a generator; that reasoning covers the assemblers and does **not** obviously cover the validators.
**Fix: commit the validators.** They are read-only over the site, they have no dependencies, and they would make the repository self-checking.

**2026-08-13 made this worse and more urgent.** `validateAssets` was written that day and is the only thing standing between the site and a class of bug that Windows actively hides — a reference whose casing differs from the file on disk passes `fs.existsSync` locally and 404s on GitHub Pages. That has already happened once on this project. It lives in the scratchpad like the rest, so the single safeguard against a silent production 404 is a file that exists nowhere in version control.

### 10l. `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` has no guard against being hand-edited wrong
Found 2026-08-11: the working tree held `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL = 'admin@nulostudio.com'` in `appsScript/config.gs`, an **uncommitted** change — `git log --all -p` shows only `'Bluegridls@gmail.com'` was ever committed. `appsScript/localTestRunner.js` already asserts `no recipient anywhere is admin@nulostudio.com`, and running it against the corrupted file failed that exact check, proving the drift rather than merely suspecting it. Reverted; the file now matches `HEAD` byte for byte.
Real exposure was narrow — `notifications.gs` only reaches this constant when the Sheet's `config.notificationEmail` cell is blank or missing — but the failure mode if it had shipped is serious: customer lead notifications routing to Nulo Studio instead of the client, which `notifications.gs`'s own header comment says must never happen.
**Nothing would have caught this before a commit.** The harness that proves it wrong only runs when someone remembers to run it; there is no pre-commit hook, and the validator toolchain itself lives outside the repo (item 10i) so there is nothing to point a hook at yet. Worth a look once 10i is addressed: run `appsScript/localTestRunner.js` as part of whatever makes the validators self-checking.

### 10m. Modal Step 1's heading undersells what it asks for
`data-step="1"`'s heading still reads **"Where's the property?"**, unchanged since it was written for a step that asked only for address and acres. As of 2026-08-11 the same step also collects Full Name, Phone, and Service Needed — three fields the heading gives no hint of.
**Left as-is deliberately**, per explicit instruction not to touch copy while fixing the CTA behavior. A landowner mid-form is unlikely to be confused (the labels are self-explanatory), but the heading is now doing less work than it should. **Fix, next time copy is in scope:** something like "Tell us about you and the property" — a two-line change, no validation or field impact.

### 10j. Structured data duplicates rendered copy with nothing enforcing the match
FAQ answers and service descriptions exist twice on the same page: once rendered, once inside `application/ld+json`. Google requires `FAQPage` questions and answers to match the visible text.
Three questions had already drifted before 2026-08-11 and were fixed; the copy sweep briefly broke the rest before the schema pass caught up. `validateSeo` now compares **questions**, and nothing yet compares **answers**.
**Fix: extend `validateSeo` to diff answer text too**, or generate both from one source.

### 10k. `Service` schema restates the provider instead of referencing it
`seoPlan.md` specifies `provider` as an `@id` reference to the homepage `LocalBusiness`. What ships is an inline stub (`name`, `telephone`, `url`) on 13 pages. It is valid and does not create competing entities, so it was left alone.
**Deliberately deferred to the domain sweep:** an `@id` is a URL, and adding 13 more production-domain-dependent values before the domain is settled would mean writing them twice. Do this in the same pass as item 1.

### 11. ~~`robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` do not exist~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-13**
Both exist. Sitemap carries **28 URLs**, matching the 28 tracked HTML pages, generated from the canonical tag on each page so the two cannot drift. Regenerate rather than hand-edit.

### 12. Open Graph images are still relative on all 28 pages — **STILL OPEN, verified 2026-08-15**
`og:url` **is** finalized: all 28 pages carry an absolute `https://www.bluegridlandsolutions.com/...`.

`og:image` is **not**. Measured this closeout: 27 pages use a `../graphics/...` relative path and 1 uses `graphics/...`. **Open Graph images must be absolute or the preview does not render** — a relative path is meaningless to Facebook's crawler.

**This matters more for this client than the generic case.** BlueGrid's stated distribution channel is Facebook: the site links to the page in the header, footer, a dedicated section and the final CTA. Every link Chase posts will currently render without an image.

**Fix:** one sweep prefixing `https://www.bluegridlandsolutions.com/` and flattening the `../`. Cheap, mechanical, and `validateAssets` will not catch it because the relative paths *do* resolve locally — that is exactly why it survived.

**Also stale, same sweep:** all 28 pages still carry `<!-- TODO: Replace canonical ... -->` and `<!-- TODO: Swap og:url ... -->` comments whose work is already done for canonical and `og:url`. Delete the comments so the next reader is not misled into re-doing finished work.

### 12a. Apex vs `www` — direction unverified
`CNAME` is `bluegridlandsolutions.com` (apex). Every canonical, `og:url` and the `robots.txt` sitemap line point at `https://www.bluegridlandsolutions.com/` (**www**). Confirmed this closeout that `https://www.bluegridlandsolutions.com/` **does serve the real site**, so this is not broken — but which host is canonical and which redirects was **not** verifiable from here.
**Next session or Aron:** `curl -I` both hosts and confirm one 301s to the other, and that the survivor is the one the canonicals name. Split host signals are a slow, quiet SEO cost.

### 13. Chase owner introduction video missing
The section is built, video-ready, and ships a polished placeholder. Supplying it is a two-field config change — `introVideoUrl` + `introVideoConfigured` — with YouTube, Vimeo, and self-hosted all supported. No code debt; purely awaiting the asset.

### 14. Facebook embed disabled
`facebookPageConfigured: false`, so a designed fallback panel shows instead of the live Page Plugin. The real page URL is already in config. Needs someone to confirm the page renders in the plugin, then flip the flag.

### 15. Google Business Profile does not exist
`googleBusinessUrl` is empty; the footer icon is hidden at runtime rather than shipping a dead `#` link. Local SEO is meaningfully weaker without a GBP.
**Work has started outside the repository:** GBP service artwork is being staged locally in `graphics/GBP - Services/`, which is git-ignored by design (marketing collateral, not website assets). The playbook is `docs/phasePrompts/phase6GoogleBusinessProfile.md`.

### 16. Insights articles have no publication dates
By instruction: no visible date, no `datePublished`, no `dateModified`, no `<time>`. Each `Article` schema carries a comment explaining the omission.
Google does not require dates, but they help freshness signals and readers use them to judge relevance. When a publishing workflow exists, add them in the article data and drop the schema comments — **and relax the validator check, which currently fails if a date appears.**

## Low Priority

### 17. Shared chrome is duplicated across 28 pages
Header, mobile drawer, estimate modal, footer, and floating actions are copied into every page — roughly 900 lines × 24. Inherent to a no-build static site.
Mitigated: interior pages are generated by guarded assemblers, not hand-copied, and `applyBusinessConfig()` drives phone/email/social from one place at runtime. **A nav change now requires editing 24 files** — this session's two chrome passes each needed a scripted, guarded run to be safe. See *Consider a build step*.

### 18. Service-link path repointing has now been rediscovered three times
Service links have **three** path forms: root pages use `services/x.html`, pages inside `services/` use the bare sibling `x.html`, and every other one-level folder uses `../services/x.html`. Chrome spliced out of a `services/*.html` page therefore carries the sibling form and must be repointed.
Three separate one-shot generators have independently hit this — the second only after the link validator caught 63 broken references, the third (2026-08-06) caught before writing because its guard compared link sets first. Note the middle case is the one `projectState.md` used to describe as a two-variant rule; that has been corrected.
It belongs in the Phase 13 generator rather than in each script's memory.

### 19. Current page is not highlighted in the mega menus
`servicePageArchitecture.md` (Shared Template Anatomy, row 1) specifies it. Not implemented — the header block is byte-identical across all 28 pages. Confirmed at closeout: no `aria-current` or current-state class exists in either `js/indexJS.js` or `css/styleIndex.css`.
Now that all four panels share `.megaRow`, this is **one rule and one small routine for the whole system** rather than four implementations: mark the row whose `href` resolves to `window.location.pathname` and style `.megaRow[aria-current]`.
**Not done alongside the Our Company work on 2026-08-09**, though this note suggested it — that pass was held to its two stated objectives. Still worth doing, and now covers four panels and 28 pages.

### 20. ~~The 1150px header headroom is about to be spent~~ — SPENT AND RE-BUDGETED 2026-08-09
"Our Company" cost **144px including its gap**. The compact header went 988px → **1131px** and full spacing 1080px → **1236px**.

Both breakpoints moved, and neither typography, the phone chip, the CTA nor any spacing token was shrunk to make room:

- **Mobile switch 1150px → 1200px.** At 1151px the five-item bar had +20px on Inter and **−22px on the `'Segoe UI'` fallback** — it would have wrapped on first paint for a cold cache. At 1201px it clears by **+70px / +11px**. 1176px was the arithmetic minimum and left 4px, which is not a margin.
- **Compact band 1280px → 1360px.** With five items the *full-spacing* band became the tightest point on the whole sweep (+45px at 1281px), which is the wrong shape — the widest band should not be the one under pressure. 1360px is `.headerInner`'s own `max-width`: above it the inner is capped so full spacing always clears by 124px, below it every pixel of viewport is a pixel of header.

`validateHeader` now also sweeps a **6%-inflated fallback face**, so the criterion the switch was chosen on has a test. `measureHeader` **reads the primary nav out of `index.html`** rather than carrying its own copy — the old copy is why the model went on describing a four-item bar.

**Remaining headroom is real but finite: a sixth nav item would push the compact header past 1200px and force the switch up again.** Re-run `validateHeader` after any nav change.

### 21. Hero animation durations are duplicated between CSS and JS
`heroDuetConfig.forwardSweepMs` (1400) and `reverseDissolveMs` (1800) in `js/indexJS.js` must stay in lockstep with `transition: --heroSweepPos 1400ms` and `transition: opacity 1800ms` in `css/styleIndex.css`. Nothing enforces the pairing.
They agree today, and the loop now awaits the dissolve so a drift would show as a visible gap rather than a desync — but it would still be wrong. Cleanest fix: read the durations from CSS custom properties via `getComputedStyle`.

### 22. Six project photos are on disk but referenced nowhere
`graphics/images/after_minfordOH.JPG` (427KB, renamed from `after.JPG` on 2026-08-13) was committed in `fb15070` alongside the hero refresh. **Re-verified 2026-08-13: still referenced nowhere** in any HTML, CSS, or JS. It appears to be the previous `hero_after` image kept as a backup.
Harmless but it ships to visitors' hosting. Left in place because it is the client's asset, not one this project created — the 2026-08-07 GBP cleanup deliberately removed only the asset Aron named.

**Widened 2026-08-13.** `validateAssets` now reports every unreferenced project photo rather than tracking this one by hand. It found six on 2026-08-13; **five remain** after the Minford page took one:

| File | Size | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `after_minfordOH.JPG` | 417KB | The original orphan above. |
| `whatTheyDo.jpg` | 345KB | **Newly discovered.** `whatTheyDo2.jpg` is referenced; this one never was. Pre-existing, not caused by the rename. |
| `B4MulchingJob_minfordOH.jpg` | 72KB | **New file, dropped in 2026-08-13.** Never referenced. |
| `mulchingJob_minfordOH.jpg` | 59KB | **New file**, the "after" partner to the above. |
| `b4ForestryMulch_minfordOH.jpg` | 65KB | **New file.** |
| ~~`afterForestryMulching_minfordOH.jpg`~~ | 62KB | **No longer orphaned** — placed on the new Minford location page 2026-08-13. |

The four new ones are two before/after pairs and are the strongest candidates yet for the galleries item 8 says are missing — they are small, recent, and carry confirmed Minford provenance. **Deliberately not placed on any page:** which photo belongs where is an editorial decision, and the rename task was explicitly scoped to repairing references, not adding imagery.

### 23. `dashboardMetrics` tab is created empty
`setupSpreadsheet()` creates the tab but writes no formulas. The formula set is specified in `docs/googleSheetArchitecture.md` but must be entered by hand. The dashboard SPA (Phase 2) computes its own numbers and does not read this tab, so nothing is blocked.

### 24. ~~Photo upload not implemented~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-13**
Photos now upload to Drive before the lead is created, and the owner's notification carries working links. See the journal entry and the *Resolved* table. What replaced it is items 24b–24f below, which are the real trade-offs the implementation chose rather than a restatement of the old gap.

### 24a. ~~Lead identifier has no internal/customer-facing split~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-13**
`leadId` is now internal and sequential (`BG-0001`), server-assigned inside the existing `LockService` section and *after* the dedupe check; `referenceId` is the customer-facing long id the browser mints and the key create dedupes on. Both are columns in the sheet. See the journal entry.

### 24b. `leads.addPhotos` is a public endpoint that writes to the owner's Drive — **substantially reduced 2026-08-15**
Still public, for the same reason `leads.create` is: a browser cannot hold a secret. The bounds are now much tighter — **5 files per lead, 8MB each, 25MB aggregate, JPEG/PNG/WebP verified by content signature, a 24-hour reference window, and a 120-upload/hour global ceiling.** Worst case per reference fell from **96MB to 25MB**.

**The residual is unchanged in kind:** a `referenceId` is `BG-<timestamp>` and trivially minted, so the per-lead caps bound one lead, not one attacker. Apps Script exposes **no client IP**, so per-caller limiting is impossible and the hourly ceiling is the only global brake. It fails **open** on a cache outage, deliberately — a cache failure must not stop a real customer.

**Watch for:** unexplained growth in `BlueGrid Lead Photos`, or folders whose `referenceId` matches no row in `leads`.

### 24c. Abandoned and orphaned photo folders — no reclamation
Unchanged, and now the main residual of 24b. Photos upload before the lead row is written, so an abandoned submission — or a minted reference that never becomes a lead — leaves a folder with no lead behind it. Nothing reclaims that space.

Deliberately not automated: a routine that deletes Drive folders on a schedule is a routine that can delete a real customer's photographs if its "has no lead" test is ever wrong.

**Recommended next step, not implemented:** a **reporting-only** `listOrphanPhotoFolders()` beside the other editor-run admin helpers in `Code.gs`. Read-only, no deletion, no schedule. Decide on deletion only after seeing what it actually reports.

### 24d. ~~`photoAccess` defaults assume the notification address can be granted Drive access~~ — **RESOLVED 2026-08-15**
The `ownerEmail` mode this described no longer exists. Access is now `rootInherited`: one Viewer grant on the `BlueGrid Lead Photos` root, applied once by `shareRootFolderWithOwner()`, inherited by every lead folder and photo. **Customer submissions perform no Drive sharing call at all.**

`photoViewerEmail` is a separate config key from `notificationEmail` precisely so the two can differ — which they did throughout acceptance testing.

**Verified externally 2026-08-15, and this is the part that had never been true before:** Aron tested with a **separate real Google account**. Unauthorized account → Google denied access. Authorized account → the same links opened. Both halves of the boundary exercised. Attributed to Aron's manual test; not provable from this repository.

### 24g. Content validation checks headers, not full image structure
`detectPhotoContentType()` decodes the first 48 bytes and matches magic numbers. A file with a valid JPEG header and arbitrary bytes appended passes.

**Accepted deliberately.** Full image parsing is not available in Apps Script without adding infrastructure, which is out of scope by instruction. This stops every practical disguised-file attack — executable, script, markup, archive, document — and is not a malware scanner. Do not let a future session mistake it for one.

### 24h. HEIC removed — watch early live traffic
JPEG/PNG/WebP only as of 2026-08-15. iPhones on the default *Most Compatible* setting send JPEG, so this should be invisible; iPhones set to *Current*, and Files-app picks, will now be refused with on-screen instructions to change the setting.

**This is the one refusal a real customer is likely to hit.** If early submissions show people bouncing off it, re-accepting is two lines — `image/heic` back into `ALLOWED_PHOTO_MIME_TYPES` and its `PHOTO_CONTENT_SIGNATURES` entry restored — at the cost of reintroducing the only brand-allowlist signature rule and the only format that bypasses browser downscaling.

### 24i. Customer photo retention — **unresolved policy decision, deliberately unimplemented**
`BlueGrid Lead Photos` accumulates customer photographs and customer names indefinitely. Nothing in this codebase deletes them, and **nothing should be added that does until a retention period is agreed with the client.**

Open questions: how long photos are kept after a job closes or a lead goes cold; whether deletion is manual or scheduled; and what the customer was told at submission. Raised at every photo-related session since 2026-08-14 and still unanswered.

### 24e. The owner's HTML email interpolates some field values without escaping
Pre-existing, found while adding the photo links. `buildOwnerEmailHtml()` builds its table rows as raw HTML and several cells — `fullName`, `propertyAddress`, `serviceNeeded`, `sourcePage` — go in unescaped, so a lead submitting `<b>` in their name gets bold text in the owner's inbox.
Low severity: it lands in one mailbox, Gmail strips scripting from mail, and the sheet itself is protected separately by the formula-injection defence. **Not fixed here on purpose** — it is unrelated to photos or identifiers, and this session's brief was explicit about not changing unrelated functionality. The values added by this session (`referenceId`, `leadId`, photo names) *are* escaped, so the fix is now the only inconsistency in that function.
**Fix:** wrap the plain-text cells in `escapeHtml()`. The cells that are deliberately HTML — `linkifyPhone`, `linkifyEmail`, `buildPhotoHtml` — must be left alone, which is exactly why the array mixes the two and why this was easy to get wrong in the first place.

### 24f. `photoCount` can disagree with the number of stored photos
`photoCount` is what the browser said it was attaching; `photoUrls` is what actually reached storage. They differ whenever an upload fails, and that difference is deliberate — it is how the owner's email knows to say "3 photos attached, upload did not complete" rather than silently reporting none.
Recorded because a future dashboard reading `photoCount` as the number of viewable images would be wrong. **Use `photoUrls.length` for anything that counts images; use `photoCount` only to detect the shortfall.**

### 25. No Lighthouse / performance pass yet
Deferred until the higher-priority items clear. Known candidates: hero images are full-resolution `2048×1536` with no responsive `srcset`; Google Fonts loads render-blocking.
**The hero typing animation is no longer on this list** — it was profiled and optimized on 2026-08-06 (see the journal entry and items 10c/10d). The two above are what remain.

### 26. Owner is not named on the site
Copy says "the owner" throughout because naming Chase publicly was never approved. For an owner-operated brand, naming him is likely stronger. One-line copy change once decided.

### 27. `MODULE_API_KEY` state cannot be verified from outside
`leads.list` returns `UNAUTHORIZED` identically whether the key is unset or merely not supplied. Only the Phase 2 dashboard depends on it; the public form does not.

---

## Future Improvements

- **Dashboard SPA (Phase 2)** — `leads.list` / `leads.update` and `MODULE_API_KEY` already exist and are tested; nothing has been built against them.
- **Weekly summary email** — `weeklySummaryDay` config key is seeded but unused; specced in `phase5Zapier.md`.
- **SMS alerts** — the one notification Apps Script cannot do natively; needs an email-to-SMS gateway or a webhook.
- **Location × service pages** — beyond forestry mulching, only where search volume justifies genuinely distinct content.
- **`locations/` hub page** — the six location pages have no index of their own; the homepage `#serviceAreas` block and the Forestry Mulching "Where We Work" section stand in. Specced as part of Phase 13.
- **Insights growth** — the section is built to scale. A new article needs only a record in the content data; the uniqueness gate and the no-dates check already apply.
- **Structured data expansion** — `LocalBusiness` omits a street address (service-area business); revisit if the client wants one public.
- **Consider a build step** — the site is at 28 pages and item 17's duplication already costs scripted, guarded passes for any nav change. Phase 13 (`phasePrompts/phase13ServiceAreaExpansion.md`) specifies the generator; its stated trigger is "hand-maintenance of location pages exceeds ~12 files", and the shared chrome has arguably hit that first.

---

## Explicitly Not Debt

Recorded so future sessions do not "fix" them:

- **No ActivityLog sheet.** Deliberate. The `leads` sheet is the success record; `errorLog` captures failures only. A second log of successful traffic adds noise and quota cost.
- **Nulo Studio is not copied on lead emails.** Deliberate client decision — the studio must not sit in the customer's email thread. Operational problems surface in `errorLog`.
- **`leads.create` is a public endpoint.** Deliberate — a browser cannot hold a secret. The honeypot, validation, and dedupe are its gate.
- **`Content-Type: text/plain` on form POSTs.** Deliberate — Apps Script web apps cannot answer a CORS preflight, so `application/json` would fail from the browser.
- **The owner's photo links point at Drive rather than being email attachments.** Deliberate: attachments would multiply MailApp quota against a 12-photo cap, cannot be re-downloaded once the mail is deleted, and would bounce on size. Links are also what the sheet can hold.
- **`leadId` is held for the whole page load, not per attempt.** Deliberate. The API dedupes on `leadId`, so a stable id lets a retry after a network failure collapse into the original row. The flow allows one submission per page load, so there is nothing to reset.
- **The unconfigured-endpoint branch in `submitEstimateRequest()` is unreachable.** Kept on purpose: it makes a blanked or mistyped endpoint obvious in the console instead of silently failing, and costs four lines.
- **Location pages do not link to each other.** Deliberate, per the Internal Linking Map in `seoPlan.md` — they pass authority up to the parent service page, not sideways. Nearby towns render as plain text pills, which is why `.nearbyList` styles `li` rather than `a`. Sitewide chrome *does* link to them; rule 4 allows that explicitly.
- **Location pages have no gallery.** No photo in the library can be honestly captioned to a named town. Adding one would mean labelling a Greenup County photo as Chillicothe work.
- **The FAQ mega menu links to service pages, not only the FAQ page.** Deliberate — several of the most common questions were already answered on a service page, and `seoPlan.md` bans restating them. The menu points at whoever owns the answer.
- **The FAQ hub shares no questions with the rest of the site.** Deliberate and enforced by a check. The site had 75 FAQs; the hub took the 28 that were left rather than competing with the service pages.
- **Mobile navigation does not render the mega menu.** Deliberate and instructed — a mega menu inside a full-screen drawer is worse than a short list.
- **The page assemblers are not in the repo.** New pages were generated once from guarded splices plus content data, then committed as plain static HTML. Phase 13 builds the real generator; shipping a half-generator now would leave two competing sources of truth.
- **CRLF working tree, LF index.** `core.autocrlf` is `true`, so Git normalises on commit and converts on checkout. Audited 2026-08-09: all 26 source files are CRLF on disk and LF in the index — **there is no mixture**, and the older note claiming some files were LF on disk was wrong. Nothing to fix; scripted edits detect and restore per file anyway.

## Resolved — moved out of debt

| Item | Resolved | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Lead capture not live | 2026-08-03 | Production `/exec` wired; `ping` returns the matching `forestryModule` / `bluegrid` / `1.0.0` identity and a honeypot POST returns a correct envelope. |
| `BlueGrid Leads` spreadsheet did not exist | 2026-08-03 | Created; `setupSpreadsheet()` and `runSelfTest()` both passed. |
| Service area pages: 0 of 13 | 2026-08-02 | First wave of 6 shipped. Remainder tracked as item 6. |
| Hero background ran past the fold on mobile | 2026-08-03 | Media layer decoupled from section height. |
| Before/after transition stopped alternating | 2026-08-03 | Dissolve made awaitable; 92/92 cycles verified. |
| `hero_after` filename casing mismatch | 2026-08-03 | Normalized in git; all 3 references updated. |
| Desktop header wrapped between ~1100–1200px | 2026-08-03 | 101px of tightening plus the switch moved to 1150px. |
| Header compact values scattered as literals | 2026-08-03 | Twelve `:root` tokens; queries reduced to overrides. |
| Estimate form had no double-submit guard | 2026-08-03 | In-flight lock, disabled button, stable `leadId`. |
| Rowan County missing from coverage data | 2026-08-02 | Added to all four places; TODO-marked for client confirmation. |
| Services mega menu had no hierarchy and an odd-numbered hole | 2026-08-06 | Featured band plus three balanced groups of two; fit measured 1151–1600px. |
| Hero typing cadence irregular; character writes off the frame boundary | 2026-08-06 | Profiled first. Rendered cadence now equals the scheduled cadence exactly; write-to-paint 8.5ms → 0ms. |
| Typed line re-rastered the hero photograph on every keystroke | 2026-08-06 | `.heroTypedLine` promoted; 8.0 megapixels/second of photo resampling removed. Residual blur cost is item 10c. |
| Mega panel styling scattered as literals | 2026-08-06 | Nine `--mega*` tokens; the FAQ panel repointed at identical values, so nothing renders differently. |
| Process grid hardcoded to 5 columns while 7 of 8 pages had 4 steps | 2026-08-07 | Those pages had been rendering with an empty fifth column. Replaced with flex; nothing assumes a step count. |
| Process section was a static scroll-reveal | 2026-08-07 | Sequenced reveal with arrow flash/dim, viewport-triggered, looping. Order verified beat by beat in simulation. |
| Both chrome assemblers double-indented their output | 2026-08-07 | They sliced from the opening tag, leaving the line's own indentation in place. Fixed in both; the services mega panel was regenerated. |
| `drawLine` animation primitive orphaned | 2026-08-07 | Existed only to animate `.processTrack`; removed with it. |
| Three mega panels, three heading treatments, two CTA patterns | 2026-08-07 | One shell, one featured card, one row primitive, one group heading. Shared rules asserted to be declared exactly once. |
| Service Areas panel ran at half the width of its siblings | 2026-08-07 | `min-width: 420px` replaced by the shared 760px shell. |
| Mega panels jumped horizontally between nav items | 2026-08-07 | Positioning moved from `.navItem` to `.primaryNav`; all three land on one rectangle. Left clearance at 1151px went 62px → 214px. |
| Mega menu flickered when the pointer crossed the 14px gap | 2026-08-07 | Transparent bridge on `.megaPanel::before`. Pre-existing since the panels were built. |
| Services panel was the one exception to the path rule | 2026-08-07 | Bare siblings inside `services/` retired; two variants again sitewide. |
| Feature branch not merged | 2026-08-07 | `phase2a-lead-capture` fast-forwarded into `main` (`8108f94..bc4021d`), 17 commits, 0 deletions, validated on `main` before pushing. Branch kept. |
| Nothing pushed to origin | 2026-08-07 | `main` pushed; local and `origin/main` synchronized at `9237e53`. |
| GBP service graphic committed by accident | 2026-08-07 | 2.6MB asset the site never loaded, swept in by a broad `git add -A` in `235a4a3`. Removed in `9237e53` after verifying zero references. |
| GBP marketing assets appearing as untracked noise | 2026-08-07 | Repository's first `.gitignore`, one rule: `graphics/GBP - Services/`. Folder stays local and intact. |
| Process sequence reset and replayed the whole board forever | 2026-08-09 | Two phases as explicit forward-only states. `resetBoard()` deleted; the assembler guards it did not survive. Verified over 120s of virtual time: 5 reveals, none repeated, **0 un-reveals**, 0 step events after the reveal. |
| Phase B read as a point chasing along the row | 2026-08-09 | Rebuilt as a cumulative sweep: highlights accumulate to all four, hold, then clear together. `lightArrow()` is its own beat — reusing Phase A's `flashArrow()` would have dimmed each arrow on the way across. 25 passes verified, each peaking at four. |
| FORESTRV misspelling on every page | 2026-08-11 | Primary mark migrated to `bluegridMark290.png`, which has no arc text. Still open for print/signage — see item 2. |
| Copy read as machine-written (447 em dashes) | 2026-08-11 | 440 rewritten by hand through 215 context-anchored rules; only the `1–2 day` numeric en dash remains, deliberately. |
| Schema and rendered FAQ copy disagreed | 2026-08-11 | Three pre-existing mismatches fixed; `validateSeo` now fails the build if a schema question is not rendered. |
| Service page H2s were design elements, not search intents | 2026-08-11 | 36 rewritten. The site's own Content Guideline 2 had required this since the plan was written. |
| Homepage H1 was duplicated and carried no intent | 2026-08-11 | "Take Back Take back your property." → "Take Back your property. Forestry mulching and land clearing in Southern Ohio and Eastern Kentucky." |
| Company page was a content orphan | 2026-08-11 | Three editorial inbound links; `validateSeo` counts body links only, so chrome does not mask it. |
| British and American spellings mixed | 2026-08-11 | Normalised to American on a US local business site. |
| Floating CTA bar cropped along its bottom edge | 2026-08-11 | A fixed height that ignored its own padding and border left the 46px buttons 1.44px taller than the 44.56px content box, so they painted over the bottom border and its rounded corners. Height now derives from content. `validateFloatingCta` fails if a height is reintroduced that does not fit. |
| Site had no About page of any kind | 2026-08-09 | `company/index.html`, 24th page, built from the `faq/` donor with chrome carried byte for byte. 865 words, **zero new CSS**, `AboutPage` schema, verified claims only. |
| Fifth nav item did not fit the header | 2026-08-09 | Switch 1150→1200px, compact band 1280→1360px. Nothing shrunk. See item 20. |
| The header model carried its own copy of the nav | 2026-08-09 | `measureHeader` reads `index.html`. It had been describing a four-item bar. |
| Mega-menu row rules were services-branded | 2026-08-09 | Company classes joined the existing selector groups rather than copying declarations — one block, two names, so the panels cannot drift. |
| "Get My Free Estimate" read as broken on the homepage | 2026-08-11, **superseded same day** | Not a routing bug — audited 227 estimate/quote anchors on 24 pages, all bare `#estimateForm` fragments, no cross-page or path issue. First fix: focus `#fullName` on click, giving unambiguous arrival regardless of scroll distance. **Real browser QA showed this wasn't what was wanted** — see the next row. |
| `DEFAULT_NOTIFICATION_EMAIL` held an uncommitted, wrong value | 2026-08-11 | Working tree had `admin@nulostudio.com`; only `Bluegridls@gmail.com` was ever committed. `localTestRunner.js`'s own guard caught it (`to=admin@nulostudio.com`) once run. Reverted to match `HEAD`. See item 10l for the recurrence risk. |
| Estimate CTAs scrolled to the mini-form instead of opening the modal | 2026-08-11 | Every `a[href="#estimateForm"]` now calls `preventDefault()` and `openEstimateModal()` directly. Required adding Name/Phone/Service to the modal's Step 1 first — see the next row — because opening the modal without them would have silently rejected every submission server-side. |
| The modal could not be opened on its own (missing Name/Phone/Service) | 2026-08-11 | Modal Step 1 gained `modalFullName`/`modalPhone`/`modalServiceNeeded`, same copy and enum order as the mini-form. `buildEstimatePayload()`, `validateModalStep(1)`, `buildReviewSummary()`, and `showSubmissionError()` repointed at the new ids — verified twice, once by static check and once by actually running the real script against a mocked DOM and inspecting the captured submission payload (`simulateEstimateFlow.js`), both proven to catch the defect by injecting it first. |
| Git remote pointed at the old repository name | confirmed resolved 2026-08-13 | `origin` now reads `.../client_BluegridLandSolutions.git`. Fixed outside any session recorded here — worth knowing this repo isn't the only place things change. |
| Whether the estimate pipeline actually works end to end | reported 2026-08-13 by Aron, not independently verified | A real submission reached the Sheet; the owner notification reached a test recipient with correct field data. Surfaced, not resolved: the photo attached to that lead was not actually accessible — see item 24, promoted to high priority the same day. |
| Submitted photos were never uploaded anywhere | 2026-08-13 | The browser held the files in memory, animated a progress bar off a timer, and dropped them on submit; `photoUrls` was hardcoded `[]`. Now each photo is downscaled client-side and POSTed to `leads.addPhotos` **before** `leads.create`, stored one folder per lead in Drive, and linked from both the sheet and the owner's email. `leads.create` reads the folder itself rather than accepting URLs from the client, so a forged POST cannot put an arbitrary link in the owner's inbox. |
| The progress bar was a lie | 2026-08-13 | `simulateUploadProgress()` filled every bar to 100% on a 160ms timer whether or not anything was being sent — it is what let a visitor believe photos had uploaded when nothing had left the browser. Deleted; progress is now driven by the upload, and a failed photo says so in the preview. |
| One identifier doing two incompatible jobs | 2026-08-13 | Split into an internal sequential `leadId` (`BG-0001`, server-assigned inside the existing lock, allocated *after* the dedupe check so a retry consumes nothing) and a customer-facing `referenceId` (the long client-minted id, now the sole dedupe key). Both columns appended per the append-only rule. Numbering derives from the sheet rather than a counter, so clearing test rows before launch is the whole reset. |
| Legacy long ids would have poisoned the new sequence | 2026-08-13 | `parseLeadNumber()` ignores anything above `MAX_SEQUENTIAL_LEAD_NUMBER`, so a `BG-1786635839698` left in the `leadId` column cannot send the next lead to `BG-1786635839699`. Proven by injecting the missing guard and confirming four checks fail. |
